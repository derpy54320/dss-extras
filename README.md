# derpy's script server - extras
These are general-purpose scripts that most servers could benefit from.
While using all of them is usually not the right choice for any one server, you are encouraged to pick some you might need.

# Updated For DSL8
Most scripts have been updated to require DSL8. Any script that used the "dsl" table now uses the "net" table.
The SetScriptCleanup function is also no longer used, since it was removed from DSL8.

# Server Manual
See the [server manual](http://bullyscripting.net/server.html) for documentation on most of these scripts.
It covers what they do, how to use them, and how to script for them.

# Using Basync
The "basync" scripts provide *basic sync*. They are quite complex, so they are not documented in the normal server manual.
Instead, you'll need to read about it in [basync.html](./scripts/basync/basync.html).

# Contribute
If you're interested in working on any of these scripts feel free to start a discussion, open an issue, or make a pull request.
