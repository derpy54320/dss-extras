# derpy's script server - extras
These are general-purpose scripts that most servers could benefit from. While using all of them is usually not the right choice for any one server, you are encouraged to pick some you might need.

# Server Manual
See the [server manual](http://bullyscripting.net/server.html) for documentation on these scripts.
It covers what they do, how to use them, and how to script for them.

# Sync Development
The sync scripts are far from finished, but are now available for you to play with or even help develop.
They are currently not documented in the server manual, but may be discussed in github.

# Contribute
If you're interested in working on any of these scripts, feel free to start a discussion or make a pull request.
