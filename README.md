# derpy's script server - extras
These are the scripts that come with derpy's script server in the "extras" folder, as well as some new ones that didn't make it into a server release.
They can all run independently or be configured to integrate with each other.

# Server Manual
See the [server manual](http://bullyscripting.net/server.html) for documentation on these scripts.
It covers what they do, how to use them, and how to script for them.

# Sync Development
The sync scripts are far from finished, but are now available for you to play with or even help develop.
They are currently not documented in the server manual, but may be discussed in github.

# Contribute
If you're interested in working on any of these scripts, feel free to start a discussion or make a pull request.
