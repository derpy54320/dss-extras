# derpy's script server - extras
These are general-purpose scripts that most servers could benefit from.
While using all of them is usually not the right choice for any one server, you are encouraged to pick some you might need.
If you're interested in working on any of these scripts feel free to start a discussion, open an issue, or make a pull request.

# Server Manual
See the [server manual](http://bullyscripting.net/server.html) for documentation on most of these scripts.
It covers what they do, how to use them, and how to script for them.
