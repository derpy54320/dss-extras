LEADER BASED SYNC - derpy54320

LEADER PLAYER:
only one player is chosen as the leader, and the server will listen to this player for the main updates about game state.
the leader can only change when there is not a leader, or the current leader leaves. this is important for how some scripts are designed to handle update counting.

UPDATE COUNTS:
server scripts are meant to have the most important say in the state of the server (duh). so for certain networked things, there are server update counts.
when something on the server is "updating" it means that the server will not listen to what a player has to say about that bit of state until the player has acknowledged all updates.
when something changes from a server sync api function (the global "sync" table for other scripts), the update count goes up. when a player gets these updates, they tell the server to lower it.
this is tracked per player, unless it only deals with the leader player and cannot switch owners.

ENTITY OWNERS:
some things are only controlled by the leader (like the weather for example), but some entities (like peds) can have different owners.
this is important because some things need to be controlled by other players (like a player's ped for example, but also the vehicle they may be driving).
